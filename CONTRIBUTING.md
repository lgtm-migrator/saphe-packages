# Contributing to the Saphe Package Ecosystem

If you're reading this, you're probably thinking of contributing to this open source project. That's great! Your input is very welcome ðŸŽ‰

Contributing to the project can be done in multiple ways:

- Reporting bugs or other issues
- Proposing new features
- Implementing bug fixes or features

## Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests

To report a bug, issue, enhancement, or feature request, [submit an issue to this GitHub repository](https://github.com/saphewilliam/saphe-packages/issues/new/choose). When you create a new issue, you can select the appropriate issue template. From there, you can follow the steps in the template.

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Create a branch from `main` with the naming convention `(feature|bugfix|enhancement)/descriptive-branch-name` (e.g. feature/add-upload-field)
3. In the root directory (at the same directory level as this contributing guide), run `yarn` and `yarn build`

// TODO 4. `yarn link`

5. Run `yarn change` for each change that you make that should be added to the changelog
6. When you're done implementing your code, make sure that `yarn lint`, `yarn build` and `yarn test` pass without warnings or errors.
7. Create a [new pull request](https://github.com/saphewilliam/saphe-packages/compare) and select your branch in your forked repo as the compare branch.
