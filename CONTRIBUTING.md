# Contributing to the Saphe Package Ecosystem

If you're reading this, you're probably thinking of contributing to this open source project. That's great! Your input is very welcome ðŸŽ‰

Contributing to the project can be done in multiple ways:

- Reporting bugs or other issues
- Proposing new features
- Implementing bug fixes or features

## Reporting Bugs or Feature Requests

To report a bug, issue, enhancement, or feature request, [submit an issue to this GitHub repository](https://github.com/saphewilliam/saphe-packages/issues/new/choose). When you create a new issue, you can select the appropriate issue template. From there, you can follow the steps in the template.

## Recommended Tools and Knowledge

- Tools: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Development with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- Test-driven development with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Create a branch from `main` with the naming convention `(feature|fix|chore)/descriptive-branch-name` (e.g. `git checkout -b feature/add-upload-field`)
3. In the root directory (at the same level as this contributing guide), run `pnpm i`
4. You can use the commands `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm dev` during development. The commmand `pnpm dev` runs tests in watch mode, because we practice development test-driven.
5. Run `pnpm change` for each change that you make that should be added to the changelog
6. When you're done implementing your code, make sure that `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` pass without unintended warnings or errors.
7. Create a [new pull request](https://github.com/saphewilliam/saphe-packages/compare) and select your branch in your forked repo as the compare branch.
